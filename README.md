# RCT_Nudge_IKEA_app_2022

## Introduction 

During my master's seminar in applied behavioural economics my team an I conducted an experiment. We collaborated on a project with IKEA. The goal was to find ways to increase awareness of the IKEA shopping app. Our approach included a promt to nudge customers to download the app instead of using IKEA's Website. The main treatment was a prompt and another (control) treatment was a classic banner advertisement. We created videos of customer journey to simulate an online experiment. Unfortunately, it was not possible to conduct a real experiment on IKEA's webiste. The presentation of results are stored in this repository.

**Summary:**

• Recruited 281 participants
• Found significant results with a pairwise fisher-exact test
